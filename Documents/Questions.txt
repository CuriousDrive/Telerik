I have some questions for Sara,

1. Is it okay if I use dark theme for Visual Studio when I make videos?
2. How long do you want these videos to be?
3. How do you want me to get started with the videos?
4. Are we sharing the code on GitHub?
5. Is it okay if I share behind the scene on Curious Drive - twitter, Insta and Facebook account. 
6. Streaming?
7. Do you sponsor videos for any channels?
