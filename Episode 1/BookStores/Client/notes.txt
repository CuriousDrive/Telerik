Telerik Textboxes - 
	CSS is the same. you can assign "form-control col-6"
	It is easier to set disabled 
	You can assign Value and @bind-value
	You can not assign value in the EditForm

Telerik Dropdownlist - 
	like textboxes you can not have value for dropdown list in the edit form
	Becuase of that, you can not load state dropdown using whatever is getting loaded from the city 
	Basically cascade loading does not work in edit forms at least
	But I can show the selected state - yes this working - I am going to add this in the demo
	I used the templates and came up with this code
