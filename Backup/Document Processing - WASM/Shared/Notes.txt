-------------------------------- DOCUMENT PROCESSING --------------------------------

Scope so far => 

I am going to need some PDFs, Excel files, Word document and some files to zip them
it seems like, I am gonna need FileExporter and UploadedFileDetails class for the all demos 

I need to understand the basics of this. I need to keep the templates/pdfs in the server
And get the files on byte array using httpClient and use to download the file using GetByteArrayAsync
