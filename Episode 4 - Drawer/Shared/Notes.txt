-------------------------------- Telerik Drawer --------------------------------

Data => 
	parameter takes IEnumerable of your custom MenuItem class
	MenuItem/DrawerItem class has some field which are understood by TelerikDrawer
	Text, Icon, Url, IsSepartor

ToggelAsync() => 
	when called it expands or collapses the menu. 
	You can also call these methods from there references
	You are going to need it's reference though

@bind-SelectedItem => 
	is used for two way binding with local property 
	I could use this for showing the page header in the page header
	
MiniMode =>
	when this is set to true then you don't have to toggle and expand in order to get to the page

Mode =>
	There two types of drawer Overlay and Push
	Overlay => The menu is shown on top of your UI and then you can select the page that you want to go to
	Push => The menu shown on the left side of the toggle button

Make TelerikDrawer as Main Menu =>
	@Body is property of LayoutComponentBase class which is inherited by MainLayout
	So I had to add TelerikDrawer there and added in TelerikRootComponent

Things that I need to check out 
2 - Check out events when Item is selected, toggle, expand, collapse
3 - ItemTemplate
4 - Template
