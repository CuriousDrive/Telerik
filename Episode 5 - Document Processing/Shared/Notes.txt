-------------------------------- DOCUMENT PROCESSING --------------------------------

Scope so far => 

I am going to need some PDFs, Excel files, Word document and some files to zip them
it seems like, I am gonna need FileExporter and UploadedFileDetails class for the all demos 

I need to understand the basics of this. I need to keep the templates/pdfs in the server
And get the files on byte array using httpClient and use to download the file using GetByteArrayAsync 

1 - PDF Processing 
	=> Create and Download
		-> I had to add some packages 
		-> I copied the razor component from the demos
		-> I needed add dcoument processing/docs from the demo project
		-> Then made a web API to download/send the file/template to the client
		-> Then I used httpClient.GetByteArrayAsync() to get the file in Blazor WASM before updating it
		-> Then I used JS interop to download the modified files from the component
	=> Merge, Split, Append and Prepend Content
		-> I had to put the documents in my local machine in order to show the demo
		-> Also I had write another web api which returns the template file to show append demo 

2 - Spreadsheet Processing 

	=> Export Files
		-> I added my Books component for this and exported the data as Sales Report for the books
	=> Spread Streaming Processing
		-> I added Authors component with 5000 records and used t

3 - Word Processing



4 - Zip Library



-------------------------------- DOCUMENT PROCESSING --------------------------------

	Questions to ask => 
		-> What if I want to export PDF in landscape format?
		-> Shouldn't there be a Enum for Number Formating?
		-> General Feedback - For spread stream processing not all the files are there in docs
		->
