-------------------------------- DOCUMENT PROCESSING --------------------------------

Scope so far => 

I am going to need some PDFs, Excel files, Word document and some files to zip them
it seems like, I am gonna need FileExporter and UploadedFileDetails class for the all demos 

I need to understand the basics of this. I need to keep the templates/pdfs in the server
And get the files on byte array using httpClient and use to download the file using GetByteArrayAsync 

1 - PDF Processing 
	-> I had to add some packages 
	-> I copied the razor component from the demos
	-> I needed add dcoument processing/docs from the demo project
	-> Then made a web API to download/send the file/template to the client
	-> Then I used httpClient.GetByteArrayAsync() to get the file in Blazor WASM before updating it
	-> Then I used JS interop to download the modified files from the component

2 - Spreadsheet Processing
